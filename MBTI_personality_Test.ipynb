For Catholicism, their teachings of Christ are said to be protected by...|||Priests were relocated to other parishes so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle thing themselves. Again, poor decision but that was their decision.  The church's first priority...|||Well sure then. Yes, the church did protect child offenders. The church's reasoning was the image of the church itself and the their leadership's own ignorance of the size of the problem. The church...|||Edit: Based double post|||No, it really isn't.

We are to learn to love in it.|||Disappointed 24 year old reporting in.  Good luck, OP.|||This is exceedingly naive. The early church, before scripture, applied their teaching to better society.

Feel free to ask/argue/chat/or bullshit with me if you want. Have a good one, man.|||I'd say that's a stretch to say. Catholics believe the bible was inspired by God but written by men. Orthodox do too. As they assembled the biblical canon I'd have to say they have the greatest say...|||Edit: Welp.|||I see the arguments for inconsistencies. Sometimes they aren't actually inconsistencies. Sometimes they are. I find the simplest example of a true one being the rabbit that is apparently chewing...|||Sorry to take so long to get back to you, my internet has been screwing up horribly.  As for the answer, there was a considerable amount of things that got me off the atheist train but if I were to...|||The believing portion was a long and arduous process for me.
